# Pico-8 Console Samples
These are some simple carts
with sample code for various
graphical effects on the 
Pico-8 Fantasy Console.

These carts will be a
combination of ported code 
from other sources and my own
bits and pieces. Ported code
will be attributed in the cart
source file itself.

All code is written and edited
in the Pico-8 Console ifself
and I don't like hidden code
that you need to horizontally
scoll to see, so all the p8
files in this repository have
a very short 30 character line
length!
